* About
  ~goto~ is a small Bash script & function to maintain a list of aliases that
  can be used to quickly jump to any directory in the filesystem.
  
* Installing
  On a modern Debian system just use
  #+begin_src sh
    sudo make install
  #+end_src
  
* Uninstalling
  The Makefile provides ~uninstall~, and if you provide the exact same
  parameters as for ~install~,
  #+begin_src sh
    sudo make uninstall
  #+end_src
  should remove all files.
  + catch 1 :: folders created during installation will not be removed at the
               moment (e.g. =/usr/local/share/bash=).
  + catch 2 :: the 'source' line will be removed from the bashrc, but one empty
               line that is inserted during 'install' is currently not being
               removed.
